## To do list
1. add the function counter form the __one.ipynb__ and add it it __Tester.py main class__
2. find a way to predict the feature label, the features engineer about the dataset
3.  


----
1. do some backtrader on the indicator
2. 



tihnk as a machine learning engineer and testing and deploying of models and that person want to become a computer scientist, wnat to figure out how computer and all the aspect that has made the computer. that person as a machine learning engineer does not have a heavy background in mathematic but also can deal with models without undersanding fully how they are working..



|Task	|Sub-Task|	Time|


Experiment with different model architectures	Try implementing LSTM or GRU	1 hour
Experiment with different model architectures	Compare performance with current model	1 hour
Try adding more layers to the current model	Test different numbers of layers	1 hour
Implement regularization techniques such as dropout to prevent overfitting	Add dropout after each linear layer	1 hour
Experiment with different window sizes and see how it affects the model's performance	Test window sizes of 20, 30, and 40	30 minutes
Use cross validation to evaluate the model's performance	Implement k-fold cross validation	30 minutes
Add more features to the input data and see how it affects the model's performance	Add technical indicators such as moving averages	1 hour
Test the final model on unseen data and make any final adjustments	Prepare test set and evaluate performance	1 hour
